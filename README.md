## **Command Cooldowns**

You can now set cooldowns on commands to limit how frequently they can be used:

```json
{
  "alias": "kitdaily",
  "cooldownSeconds": 86400,
  "cooldownMessage": "<red>You can only use this once per day! Wait <yellow>{remaining}</yellow> seconds."
  // other command properties...
}
```

- **cooldownSeconds**: Time in seconds before the command can be used again by the same player
- **cooldownMessage**: Message shown when on cooldown (use {remaining} to show seconds left)
- Cooldowns persist between server restarts
